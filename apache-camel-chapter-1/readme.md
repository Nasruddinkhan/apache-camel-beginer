Chapter 1 - File Copy with Java & Camel
==============================================

Apache Camel is an open-source integration framework designed to simplify the development of enterprise integration solutions. It provides a way to connect different systems and technologies by defining routing and mediation rules. Apache Camel offers a wide range of components and integration patterns, enabling developers to efficiently handle various data formats, protocols, and systems without writing extensive custom code. It's commonly used for creating robust and scalable integration solutions within applications and across systems.

In simple terms, Apache Camel is like a translator for different computer systems. It helps them talk to each other by providing a common language and rules for exchanging information. It's useful when you want different software to work together and share data easily without having to write a lot of custom code.

In Apache Camel, "file copy" means using its features to automatically move or copy files from one location to another as part of an integration solution. It simplifies the process of handling files between different systems or directories by providing built-in tools and components for file-related operations.
