Chapter 2 - Core Camel -Transforming data with Camel
====================================================

In this chapter, we introduced essential topics in Camel for beginners. Now, in the following section, we'll delve deep into Camel's core features, crucial for real-world use.

Six ways data transformation typically takes place in Camel
===========================================================
Transformation Method	  | Description                           
------------- | --------------------------------------------
Route-level Message Translation	| Employ Message Translator or Content Enricher EIPs within routes to explicitly enforce data transformation. This allows data mapping using regular Java code..
Component-based Data Transformation	| Leverage Camel's assortment of components for transformation, such as the XSLT component tailored for XML transformation.
Data Format-driven Transformation	| Utilize Camel transformers, known as data formats, that facilitate bidirectional data conversion between established formats.
Template-based Data Transformation	| Employ various components in Camel, like Apache Velocity, to transform using templates.
Data Type Conversion via Camel's Mechanism	| Rely on Camel's sophisticated type-converter mechanism, activated on demand, for seamless conversion between common types.
Component Adapter Message Transformation	| Numerous Camel components adapt to widely used protocols, necessitating message transformation. These involve custom data transformations and type converters.
