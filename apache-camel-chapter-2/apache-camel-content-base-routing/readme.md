It this setup a Camel route that reads files from a directory and publishes them to different ActiveMQ queues based on the file extension. This route is defined using the Camel DSL (Domain-Specific Language).

1. Read File from Directory and Publish to jms:incomingProducts:
    `from("file:D:\\Projects\\sftp-inbound?noop=true")
    .log("Received file: ${header.CamelFileName}")
    .to("jms:incomingProducts");`
   1. The from statement specifies the source endpoint, which is a file endpoint in the directory `D:\\Projects\\sftp-inbound`.
   2. The noop=true parameter means that the file is not deleted after processing.
   3. The log statement logs a message indicating the name of the received file.
   4. The to statement sends the content of the received file to the jms:incomingProducts queue in ActiveMQ.

2.  Publish to Different Queues Based on File Extension: 
    `from("jms:incomingProducts")
       .choice()
       .when(header("CamelFileName").endsWith(".json")).to("jms:jsonProducts")
       .when(header("CamelFileName").endsWith(".xml")).to("jms:xmlProducts")
       .otherwise().to("jms:csvProducts");`
    1. The `from` statement listens to the jms:incomingProducts queue in ActiveMQ for incoming messages.
    2. The `choice` statement starts a conditional routing logic.
    3. The `.when(header("CamelFileName").endsWith(".json")).to("jms:jsonProducts")` line checks if the file name ends with `.json `and if true, sends the message to the `jms:jsonProducts` queue.
    4. The `.when(header("CamelFileName").endsWith(".xml")).to("jms:xmlProducts")` line checks if the file name ends with `.xml` and if true, sends the message to the `jms:xmlProducts` queue.
    5. The `.otherwise().to("jms:csvProducts")` line is a fallback, sending messages with other file extensions to the `jms:csvProducts`.
